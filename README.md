# BeeLight - Motorcycle light display device

## Overview
This navigation pod intends to provide riders with a customizable light display for their motorcycles instead of the typical phone mount to indicate navigation turn-by-turn instructions.

As a vintage bike owner, I did not want to pollute the classical aesthetic of my bike with a weird looking plastic mounting or a 6.5" phone screen. That's why I wanted to create a minimalist and elegant solution to display the navigation instructions in a more subtle way.

Use the BeeLight companion app to send navigation instructions to the device via Bluetooth.

# Inspirations
First inspiration came with [this video](https://youtu.be/WXN7OLOQ_Lw?si=_FYmlNY_r71BRb2q) of cam shand making a Pixel Watch mount for his 350Z. But the heating issue when always on while charging was a no-go for me.

Then I found those ready to use ESP-32 with aluminium case featuring round display like the [Guition JC3636W518](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005007890666293.html) I got for a very low price. I was surprised by the quality of the screen and the case for such a low price.

After starting the projet in March 2025, I found that [Beeline Moto II](https://beeline.co/products/beeline-moto-ii) was quite similar to what I wanted to achieve so I think I should mention I got inspired for the project name.
They really did a good job on the design and the user experience. However, I found it a bit too expensive and I wanted to be able to customize the display.

Finally, I had in mind that the user should not change his habits using this device by using a dedicated navigation app. So I wanted to use the same app as the one used on the phone, and just mirror the navigation instructions on the display.
